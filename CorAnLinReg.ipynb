    "Impact of Oil Prices and NOK Exchange Rate on Energy Sector Stock Prices\n",
    "Our analysis investigated the effects of fluctuations in oil prices and the Norwegian Krone (NOK) exchange rate on the stock prices of key energy sector companies listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. By integrating daily data on oil prices, NOK exchange rates, and stock prices, we performed both correlation analysis and linear regression to quantify these relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation Findings: The correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between oil prices and the stock prices of Equinor ASA (EQNR-NO), suggesting that as oil prices increase, so too do the stock prices of Equinor. This relationship highlights the dependency of energy companies on commodity prices, reflecting broader industry trends where oil price movements significantly influence market valuations of energy firms. Conversely, the correlation between the NOK exchange rate and Equinor's stock prices was less pronounced, indicating that while exchange rate fluctuations impact financial performance, their effect is comparatively muted against the backdrop of global oil price dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression Analysis: The linear regression model further quantified these effects, showing statistically significant coefficients for both oil prices and NOK exchange rates. The model indicated that oil prices have a more substantial and statistically significant impact on stock prices than exchange rate fluctuations. This finding underscores the critical role that commodity prices play in the financial health and stock performance of energy companies. The regression coefficients provide a clear measure of how a unit change in oil prices or NOK exchange rates is expected to influence the stock prices, offering valuable insights for investors and analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implications for Stakeholders: For investors, understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed investment decisions, particularly in a volatile energy market influenced by both geopolitical factors and currency fluctuations. Energy companies and policymakers can also benefit from these insights by better anticipating market responses to changes in oil prices and exchange rates, thus enhancing strategic planning and risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations and Further Research: While the analysis provides significant insights, it is subject to the inherent limitations of historical data and the assumption that past patterns will persist. Future research could expand to include more granular data, consider additional variables such as geopolitical events or new energy policies, and apply more complex models to capture the nonlinear dynamics of the markets."
