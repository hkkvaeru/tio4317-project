# TIÃ˜4317 Project - Improving Forecasts of Energy Stock Returns Using Commidity Prices & FX Rates 

## Project Description

This project applies time-series analysis for forecasting stock prices. Specifically, we examine the explanatory power of external economic factors such as oil & gas prices, along with currency exchange rates, in daily stock return prediction of select Norwegian public companies on the Oslo Stock Exchange. We have employed Python with relevant packages to curate an appropriate dataset for the task at hand. Reproducible code, along with our findings, is available through the Jupyter Notebook Report.ipynb.
